The chimpanzee is an omnivorous primate known for its remarkable intelligence and social behaviors. These highly adaptable creatures are primarily herbivores, feeding on fruits, leaves, and occasionally insects. Chimpanzees are found in dense forests and savannas across Central and West Africa. They live in complex social groups, exhibiting intricate communication, tool usage, and problem-solving abilities. Chimpanzees play a crucial role in their ecosystems as seed dispersers and contribute to the biodiversity of their habitats.

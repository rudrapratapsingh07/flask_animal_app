Zebras, with their distinctive black and white striped coats, epitomize the beauty of the African savanna. These social animals form tight-knit herds, providing safety in numbers as they graze on the grasslands. Their stripes serve as natural camouflage, helping to confuse predators such as lions and hyenas. Zebras are herbivores, primarily feeding on grass, and their constant movement across the plains helps prevent overgrazing in any one area. Despite their striking appearance, zebras are often preyed upon by large carnivores, relying on their speed and agility to evade capture. Within their herds, zebras communicate through various vocalizations and body language, fostering strong social bonds. Their presence in the wild is not only a testament to the diversity of Africa's ecosystems but also a symbol of resilience in the face of adversity.

The hyena, often associated with scavenging, is a highly adaptable carnivore found in various habitats across Africa and parts of Asia. With its distinctive appearance characterized by a sloping back, powerful jaws, and a haunting vocalization, the hyena is an integral part of the African savanna ecosystem. Despite their reputation as scavengers, hyenas are skilled hunters capable of taking down prey much larger than themselves, using teamwork and persistence to overwhelm their targets. Their versatile diet includes not only carrion but also a wide range of animals, from small rodents to large ungulates. Highly social animals, hyenas live in complex clan structures led by dominant females, with strong social bonds and intricate communication through vocalizations and body language. Despite their often misunderstood nature, hyenas play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance as both predators and scavengers, helping to regulate prey populations and recycle nutrients in their environment.

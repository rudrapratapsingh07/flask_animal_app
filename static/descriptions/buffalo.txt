The buffalo, often referred to as the American bison, is a herbivorous mammal native to North America. It is known for its massive size, shaggy coat, and distinctive hump. Buffaloes are primarily found in grasslands and prairies, where they graze on various grasses and plants. Historically, buffaloes played a vital role in the culture and livelihoods of indigenous peoples, providing food, clothing, and materials for shelter. Today, they are revered as symbols of strength and resilience, representing the untamed wilderness of the American West.

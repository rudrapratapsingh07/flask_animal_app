Sheep, gentle herbivores known for their fluffy wool and docile nature, are essential domesticated animals found in pastoral landscapes worldwide. Revered for their role in agriculture, sheep provide a myriad of resources, including wool, meat, and milk. Their thick, insulating fleece not only protects them from harsh weather conditions but also serves as a valuable commodity for textiles and clothing. Sheep are often seen grazing peacefully in lush meadows or rolling hills, forming tight-knit flocks led by a dominant ram. Their social structure fosters cooperation and protection, with ewes nurturing their young lambs within the safety of the flock. While historically associated with rural life and traditional farming practices, sheep continue to play a vital role in modern agriculture, sustaining livelihoods and economies across the globe.

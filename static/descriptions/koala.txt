The koala, native to Australia, is an iconic marsupial known for its adorable appearance and unique lifestyle. Primarily arboreal, koalas spend most of their time in eucalyptus trees, where they feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves. These leaves not only serve as their main source of nutrition but also provide hydration, as koalas rarely drink water directly. With their specialized digestive systems, koalas can process the tough, fibrous eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to many other animals. Koalas are solitary animals, except during the breeding season, and communicate through vocalizations and scent marking. Their distinctive "koala bear" nickname is misleading, as they are not bears but rather marsupials. Koalas are marsupials, meaning they carry their young, known as joeys, in a pouch. Threatened by habitat loss, disease, and climate change, koalas are classified as vulnerable and require conservation efforts to ensure their survival.

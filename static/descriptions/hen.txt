A hen is a domesticated bird, renowned for its egg-laying abilities and social nature. Hens play an essential role in agriculture by providing a steady source of eggs and meat. They thrive in diverse environments, from backyard coops to large-scale farms, and are known for their pecking and scratching behaviors that help control insect populations and aerate the soil.

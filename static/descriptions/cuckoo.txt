The cuckoo, a fascinating bird famed for its distinctive call, is recognized for its unique reproductive strategy. Found in various habitats worldwide, cuckoos are known for their parasitic nesting behavior, wherein they lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species, relying on them to raise their young. With their sleek bodies and cryptic plumage, cuckoos often blend seamlessly into their surroundings, making them challenging to spot. Their haunting calls are a harbinger of spring in many regions, marking the arrival of warmer weather and the onset of the breeding season. While some cuckoo species are migratory, traveling vast distances to breed and winter, others are resident, inhabiting their territories year-round. Despite their enigmatic nature, cuckoos play an essential role in ecosystems as both predators of insects and contributors to seed dispersal.

A bear is an omnivorous animal, capable of eating both plants and animals. Bears are known for their strength and adaptability, with different species found across North America, Europe, and Asia. They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by dispersing seeds and controlling animal populations. Bears are often found in forests, mountains, and tundras, and are recognized for their ability to hibernate during the winter months.
